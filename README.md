# Functa-Experiment
Reproduction of *From data to functa: Your data point is a function and you can treat it like one* and *Spatial Functa: Scaling Functa to ImageNet Classification and Generation*. The subject is to build a meta learning model with which an implicit neural representation of a data sample can be trained in no time. Techniques like SIREN and modulation are adopted. More details can be found in [Report.pdf](Report.pdf)
